# Order Of Battle

Order Of Battle is a WIP, open source, army list manager and wargame ruleset editor. It is in the early stages of development, but if you would like to contribute or try it out, feel free!

## Installation

First you will need to install the dependencies. For the backend, you will need to install Python3.10+, flask, python-dotenv, and jsonpickle. It is recommended to install these using a virtual environment. For the frontend, you will need to install Nodejs and npm. The package.json file in the frontend folder lists required packages for npm as well.


## Usage
Starting in the OrderOfBattle folder:
```bash
cd backend && flask run
#In another tab
cd orderofbattle_frontend && npm start

```
This will most likely bring up a browser page showing the application. If not, navigate to localhost:3000 to open the application.
